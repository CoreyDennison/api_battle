        <h1>Spotify artist battle app.</h1>
        <p>This is a spotify artist battle app which works by entering two artist names 
          and pressing the "Battle" button. Once that is done, the application will 
          search the Spotify API for the two names and return with their name, popularity,
          number of songs, and their roles in the music industry, such as song writer, musician,
          singer, and so on, and then compared side by side. <span>Simples?</span></p>
