        <h1>Spotify artist battle app.</h1>
        <p>This is a spotify artist battle app which works by entering two artist names 
          and pressing the "Battle" button. Once that is done, the application will 
          search the Spotify API for the two names and return with their name, popularity,
          number of songs, and their roles in the music industry, such as song writer, musician,
          singer, and so on. This information is then compared side by side, with the artist with
          the higher amount of an aspect receiving a point. These points are then tallied up, and the 
          artist with the most points is the winner. <span>Simples?</span></p>
